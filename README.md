# CSSSKL342-Class_Constructors_Inheritance_Lifespan
Exercise1:
The first part of today's lab is to learn Class in C++ and investigate how inheritance affects which methods get called and in what order constructors and destructors are called.
Please look at the 1.Inheritance folder in your download, compile and run files A.cpp, A.h, B.cpp, B.h, C.cpp, C.h and InheritanceTest.cpp.

Exercise2:
Example code to evaluate variable scope, lifespan, and lvalues; please look at the 2.LifeSpan folder in your download, compile and run files: ScopeEtc.cpp, SuperInt.cpp, and SuperInt.h

Exercise3:
Now, let's play with a pair of classes: Square and SquareContainer (you may be struggled with this one).
The latter is a dynamically allocated array of the former that can resize itself if needed.
Please look at the 3.Classes folder in your download.
The files in question are Square.cpp, Square.h, SquareContainer.cpp, SquareContainer.h and ClassTest.cpp.
Please download, compile and run these files, and convince yourself that you understand what they do.
